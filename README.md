# 🧠 OptIForest: Replication and Dataset Extension Project

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains my replication and dataset-extension work for the **IJCAI 2023 paper**  
**“OptIForest: Optimal Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection”** by *Xiang et al.*  
The project aims to:
- Reproduce the original OptIForest results on benchmark datasets.
- Construct new and enhanced datasets to test the robustness and generalisation of the model.

This work was completed as part of the **COMP8240 Research Project** at **Macquarie University (2025)**.
